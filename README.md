## 🤘 Get Your G-Wink On: Mastering Your Personal Kodi Experience 🤘

Ever found yourself battling Kodi's scrapers, trying to get your unique video collections recognized? We're talking about those cherished home videos, obscure documentaries, or even your carefully curated "adult" content that the mainstream scrapers just aren't built for. The struggle is real, and frankly, it's a drag.

That's where **Tha-G👑-Thang** steps in. We built the **Playlist G-enerator** because we understand that *your* Kodi library should reflect *your* content, without jumping through hoops. This isn't just about managing files; it's about reclaiming your personal media experience, making those "hard-to-scrape" collections seamlessly integrated and a joy to browse.

## 🌟 What is Playlist G-enerator? 🌟

**Playlist G-enerator** is a lightweight, powerhouse Kodi add-on from **Tha-G👑-Thang**. It's designed to give you direct control over your video content, allowing you to create and manage `.m3u` playlists and "Folder Sets" for files residing locally or in the cloud. It bypasses the scraper limitations, putting you in the driver's seat for organizing personal recordings, niche content, and anything else Kodi typically overlooks.

Think of it as your ultimate personal media organizer, crafted with that signature **G-angsta** attitude – powerful, efficient, and always ready to make your media bend to your will.

## ✨ Key Features (The G-Essentials) ✨

* **Custom Playlist Creation:** Effortlessly generate `.m3u` playlists from any selected folders, including subdirectories, transforming chaotic collections into organized lists.
* **Folder Sets (Presets):** Define and save "sets" of folders as reusable presets. Group your content logically (e.g., "Family Archives," "Concerts," "Secret Stash") and quickly build playlists from them.
* **Intelligent File Filtering:**
    * **Extension Filtering:** Focus on just the video formats you need.
    * **Size Constraints:** Filter by minimum and (optional) maximum file sizes.
    * **Filename Exclusion:** Automatically skip unwanted files (like "sample" or "trailer" versions).
* **Flexible Playlist Limiting:** Control the size and scope of your playlists with options for:
    * Maximum files per playlist or per folder within a set.
    * Maximum total size per playlist.
    * Custom scan depth for folder sets.
* **Dynamic Sorting:** Order your playlists by criteria such as creation date, file size, or name.
* **Enhanced Display Options:**
    * **Item Numbering:** Keep track of your place with optional numbered entries.
    * **Path Display:** Choose how file paths are shown – from full path to filename only, or a clear relative path.
    * **File Size Display:** See file sizes directly in your playlist for quick reference.
    * **Tha-G👑-Thang Flair:** Option to prefix entries with the parent folder name, boldly colored for easy identification and that extra G-wink!
* **Context Menu Download:** Directly download video links to your specified local paths right from Kodi's context menu.
    * **Smart Filename Cleaning:** Automatic cleanup of downloaded filenames, including removing unwanted words, word swapping, and advanced Regex pattern application.
    * **Discreet Adult Download Path:** Automatically divert identified "adult" content to a separate, private download folder with its own unique cleaning rules.
